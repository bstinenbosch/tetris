# Feedback week 7 
#### Group 11

## Exercise 1

### 1.1 - 16/30 pts.
- The point of the exercise was to change things this week. You referred to a couple of refactors that happened last week or even long ago. 
- Lacks additional documentation
- Nice double dispatch

## Exercise 2

### 2.1 - 21/22 pts.
- Bot Modus?!!?!? Ok, the bot is random, but if you get this to work for real it would be glorious.
- Sounds are cool, try more diversity, and the theme needs too loop.
- When I toggle bot mode the menu breaks. Back and pause no longer work properly.
- You added tests.

### 2.2 - 8/8 pts.

## Exercise 3

### 3.1 - 15/15 pts.
- Ok, good
